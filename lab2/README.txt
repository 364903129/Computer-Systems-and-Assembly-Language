I would connect each switch to a LED, write down the number next to the LED, the add up the number where the LED is turned on. 

The random number generator are able to generate at most a random 8 bits number. Connect a push button with C+, every time when the push button gets pushed, a random number will appear. 

It's random because it makes the computer unpredictable.
